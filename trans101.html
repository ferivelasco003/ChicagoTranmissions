                                    The cost of a transmission repair will vary depending on the make, model, 
                                    and year of the vehicle. By simply giving us a call (773 –276-8900) we’ll be able 
                                    to give you an idea as to how much you’re going to have to invest in order to have 
                                    your transmission rebuilt. But the best course of action would be to stop by our 
                                    repair facility to have one of our trained technicians inspect your vehicle to make 
                                    sure that a rebuilt transmission is exactly what you need. During our basic 
                                    inspection we often find transmissions acting up due to a low fluid level or a 
                                    faulty sensor. </p>

                                <span class="boldTxt">How can I know if my transmission just needs a sensor replaced as opposed to needing 
                                    a complete rebuild?</span><br>
                                    The first thing you would have to do is bring your vehicle to our repair 
                                    facility where your vehicle will be properly diagnosed by a qualified technician.
                                     Upon arrival we will test drive your car to verify that a transmission problem is 
                                     present. If your check engine light is on we will perform a scan of your computer to 
                                     retrieve any trouble codes stored in the memory. The trouble codes will be a helpful 
                                     guide in determining what needs to be done in order to get your transmission up and 
                                     running. If the codes indicate a problem with a sensor or a solenoid that affect the 
                                     performance of the transmission we would have to follow the proper diagnostic procedures 
                                     for that particular code. The trouble codes are a helpful guide but they don’t pin point 
                                     the problem. Once these procedures are followed it might turn out to be a minor repair 
                                     rather than a complete rebuild that was needed.

                                     This could be a little complicated depending on what kind of vehicle you 
                                     have—nonetheless it can be done. Usually it involves either removing a fill plug 
                                     on the transmission or using a specialty tool to check it. Your best option will 
                                     be to bring it to our repair facility and we will gladly check if for you.

                                 <span class="boldTxt">If my transmission is leaking does that mean is has to be rebuilt?</span><br>
                                     Not necessarily. The first step would be to pin point the source of the leak. 
                                     This will allow us to determine the best course of action. In most cases a 
                                     transmission oil leak could be stopped without having to rebuild the transmission. 
                                     In some cases we might recommend rebuilding a transmission instead of just sealing 
                                     it because the cost ratio of sealing it is just too high. Keep in mind that if your
                                      vehicle was driven with low transmission fluid there’s a possibility that you could 
                                      have caused some kind of internal damage to your transmission. Resealing a transmission
                                       that might have been damaged due to a lack of oil might not be the best investment.
